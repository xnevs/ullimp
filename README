Compile
-------

Run make.

Or alternatively run g++ -O3 -o ullimp ullimp.cpp.


Usage
-----

./ullimp <pattern> <target>

Both graphs (pattern and target) must be in the Amalfi file format. See paper M. De Santo, P. Foggia, C. Sansone, and M. Vento, "A large database of graphs and its use for benchmarking graph isomorphism algorithms", Pattern Recognition Letters, vol. 24, pp. 1067– 1079, May 2003.
